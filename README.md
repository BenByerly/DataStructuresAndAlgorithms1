This program is a driver for managing a video game library using the VideoGameLibrary class. It allows the user to define the maximum number of video games the library can hold, then interact with the library through a menu. The menu provides options to load video games from a file, save the current games to a file, add or remove a video game, display all games, or remove all games and exit. The VideoGameLibrary dynamically manages an array of VideoGame objects, where each video game contains details like title, developer, publisher, and release year. The program includes functionality to dynamically resize the array when the maximum capacity is reached.
